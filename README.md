# ESP32 IoT Tic-Tac-Toe System
An embedded + IoT system that implements a real-time multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game.  
This project integrates local game logic on an ESP32 microcontroller with cloud-based player communication via MQTT using a Google Cloud-hosted broker.  
The system allows for human vs. cloud-scripted player modes, demonstrating secure device-to-cloud communication and interactive embedded systems design.

## Key Features
- Developed in C with ESP-IDF
- ESP32-S3 microcontroller platform
- Real-time player input via serial interface
- Automated player move generation using GCP-hosted MQTT scripts
- Cloud-to-device messaging pipeline
- Clean text-based UI and game logic
- Foundation for IoT and cloud-integrated microcontroller projects

## Technologies Used
- ESP32 (ESP-IDF)
- MQTT Protocol
- Google Cloud Compute Engine (GCP)
- C Programming
